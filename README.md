## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Dual Data Input Workflows:**
    * **Bring Your Own Data:** Upload your own high-resolution LiDAR (`.laz`/`.las`) files.
    * **Explore New Areas:** Define regions of interest directly on an interactive map by point, path, or bounding box.
* **Automated Data Acquisition:**
    * Fetches high-resolution Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) from public datasets like USGS 3DEP for regions in the USA.
    * Acquires global Digital Surface Models (DSMs) from sources like the Copernicus DEM.
    * Downloads Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for NDVI analysis.
* **Comprehensive Raster Generation:** Automatically generates a full suite of archaeologically relevant raster visualizations from elevation data, including:
    * Digital Terrain Model (DTM) & Digital Surface Model (DSM)
    * Multi-directional Hillshades
    * Slope & Aspect
    * Color Relief (Hypsometric Tinting)
    * Topographic Position Index (TPI) & Terrain Ruggedness Index (TRI)
    * Sky View Factor (SVF) / Openness
    * Composite RGB Hillshades
* **Vegetation Analysis (NDVI):** Calculates and visualizes the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2 data to identify crop marks and vegetation anomalies.
* **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection:**
    * Leverages OpenAI's vision models (e.g., GPT-4o) to analyze raster imagery for potential archaeological features.
    * Utilizes a sophisticated **modular prompt system** for precise and repeatable AI analysis.
    * Delivers structured JSON reports detailing detected anomalies, confidence scores, and visual evidence.
* **Interactive Analysis & Reporting:**
    * View, filter, and explore AI analysis results.
    * Visually verify AI detections with bounding box overlays on source images.
    * Export comprehensive analysis reports in HTML and PDF formats.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

This application relies on the powerful GDAL and PDAL libraries. You must have them installed on your system before proceeding.

**On Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
# Install GDAL
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y gdal-bin libgdal-dev

# Install PDAL
sudo apt-get install -y pdal
```
For other operating systems, please refer to the official installation guides for [GDAL](https://gdal.org/download.html) and [PDAL](https://pdal.io/en/latest/install.html).

### 2. Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Python Virtual Environment**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python Dependencies**
    The project's dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    You will need to set up credentials for the services used by the application. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following, replacing the placeholder values:
    ```
    # OpenAI API Key
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

    # Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem Credentials
    CDSE_CLIENT_ID="..."
    CDSE_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
    ```

### 3. Running the Application

Once the installation is complete, run the application using Uvicorn:
```bash
# Ensure your virtual environment is active
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the server
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```
You can now access the GeoArchaeology Terrain Processor by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

## üó∫Ô∏è Application Workflow

The application is built around a logical workflow from data input to final analysis:

1.  **Define a Region:** Start by either uploading your own LAZ/LAS files or by drawing a region of interest (point, path, or box) on the map. You can enable NDVI processing at this stage.
2.  **Acquire Data:**
    * For **LAZ files**, metadata is extracted, and if NDVI is enabled, Sentinel-2 imagery is automatically fetched.
    * For **map-defined regions**, use the "Get Data" function. This fetches a DTM/DSM and, if enabled, Sentinel-2 imagery.
3.  **Automatic Raster Generation:** Upon acquiring a DTM, the backend automatically generates the full suite of raster products (Hillshades, Slope, SVF, etc.).
4.  **Perform Analysis:**
    * **NDVI:** If satellite data was acquired, run the NDVI analysis to generate a vegetation index map.
    * **OpenAI Analysis:** Navigate to the "OpenAI Analysis" tab. Select your region(s), customize the modular prompt if needed, and send the raster imagery for AI interpretation.
5.  **Review and Export:** Go to the "Results" tab to explore the AI's findings. View the detected anomalies, inspect the visual evidence with overlays, and export the final report as HTML or PDF.
