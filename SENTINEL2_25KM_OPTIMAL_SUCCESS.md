## 🎯 OPTIMAL CONFIGURATION VALIDATION

### 25km Buffer Methodology
```
📐 PROVEN OPTIMAL FORMULA
═══════════════════════════
• Target Area: 25km x 25km
• Buffer Radius: 12.5km  
• Degrees Conversion: 12.5km ÷ 111.32 km/degree = 0.112289°
• Bounding Box: center ± 0.112289°
```

### Why 25km is Optimal
1. **High Resolution**: Both systems achieve maximum pixel density
2. **Manageable Size**: Files remain under practical limits (15-20MB)
3. **Processing Efficiency**: Fast downloads and processing
4. **Quality Balance**: Optimal trade-off between detail and coverage
5. **Universal Application**: Works for both elevation and imagery data
