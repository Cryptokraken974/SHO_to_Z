## ElevationService Integration Fix Summary

### Issue Fixed
The frontend was getting a `TypeError: ElevationService.downloadElevationData is not a function` error because the service was being called as a static method instead of being instantiated.

### Root Cause
In the UI functions (`acquireElevationData()` and `getCombinedData()`), the code was trying to call:
```javascript
ElevationService.downloadElevationData(request)  // ❌ Static call - incorrect
```

But the ElevationService is designed as an instance-based service, requiring:
```javascript
const elevationService = new ElevationService();  // ✅ Instantiate first
const result = await elevationService.downloadElevationData(request);  // ✅ Call on instance
```

### Changes Made

1. **Updated `frontend/js/ui.js`** - Fixed both functions:
   - `acquireElevationData()` (line ~2020)
   - `getCombinedData()` (line ~2140)
   
   Changed from:
   ```javascript
   const result = await ElevationService.downloadElevationData(elevationRequest);
   ```
   
   To:
   ```javascript
   const elevationService = new ElevationService();
   const result = await elevationService.downloadElevationData(elevationRequest);
   ```

2. **Fixed Import Error in `app/endpoints/laz_processing.py`**:
   - Removed duplicate import of `convert_geotiff_to_png_base64`
   - The function exists in `app/convert.py`, not `app/geo_utils.py`

3. **Updated Test File `frontend/js/elevation-service-test.js`**:
   - Fixed tests to check instance methods instead of static methods
   - Added proper instantiation testing
   - Improved error detection and reporting

### Service Architecture
The ElevationService follows the same pattern as the backend services:
- **Instance-based**: Must be instantiated with `new ElevationService()`
- **Async methods**: All operations return Promises
- **Enhanced features**: Automatic validation, regional optimization, progress tracking
- **Error handling**: Standardized error responses with detailed information

### Integration Status
✅ **Fixed**: Frontend UI functions now properly instantiate and use ElevationService  
✅ **Tested**: Integration tests updated to verify proper instantiation  
✅ **Backend**: Import errors resolved for server startup  
✅ **Ready**: Service layer integration is now complete and functional

The ElevationService is now properly integrated and ready for use in the frontend application.
