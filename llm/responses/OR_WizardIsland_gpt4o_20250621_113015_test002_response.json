          "slope": "The circle is outlined by steep gradients, especially on the outer edge, clearly defining an elevated ring structure.",
          "chm": "Vegetation height is reduced and uniform over the circular anomaly compared to surrounding forest, indicating possible regrowth on a cleared platform.",

The slope and LRM confirm sharply defined positive relief, while CHM supports the interpretation through a consistent pattern of lower canopy, typical of regrowth. The SVF also reinforces the open nature of the structure, possibly indicating a ceremonial or habitation space once maintained and cleared.",

The CHM hints at ground disturbance and regrowth consistent with a once-maintained path. This may have served as a processional or logistical route linking key features of a larger complex.",
