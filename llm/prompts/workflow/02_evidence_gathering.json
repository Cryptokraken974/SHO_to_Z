  "content": "For each 'potential anomaly' you identified, you must now systematically document its appearance across ALL available analytical rasters (`lrm`, `svf`, `slope`, `chm`, `ndvi`). Describe the visual evidence from each layer in neutral, factual terms, referencing the specific location of the anomaly. This is a comprehensive data-gathering step; interpretation will come later. For example: 'At the anomaly's location, the LRM shows a subtle positive linear feature. The slope raster shows two parallel dark lines. The NDVI raster shows no corresponding pattern.'"
