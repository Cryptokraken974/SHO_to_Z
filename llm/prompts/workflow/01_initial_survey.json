  "content": "Simultaneously examine all rasters derived from surface structure and topography: `lrm`, `svf`, `slope`, and `chm`. Use both sliding window (150Ã—150) AND vector masks from the 'linear_candidate' prepass to flag possible features. For each detection: - Perform local segmentation using the raster where the anomaly is most distinct (e.g. ridge detection on `slope` for causeways). - Once the core feature is extracted, zoom out incrementally to determine its full spatial extent, expanding until the boundary signatures fall below threshold. - From the final segmented mask, extract the true bounding box (`x_min`, `y_min`, `x_max`, `y_max`) that tightly encloses the full feature. - Ensure this process respects minimum size, shape ratios, and continuity constraints defined in the lexicon. Pass all spatially resolved detections into the next step for multi-layer documentation."
