  "content": "Your first task is a holistic survey for potential anomalies. You must simultaneously examine all rasters derived from surface structure and topography: `lrm`, `svf`, `slope`, and `chm`. Scan these layers for any features that appear potentially anthropogenic (e.g., unnatural geometric shapes, sharp linear features, regular patterns, or distinct textural zones). Flag any location that shows a clear signature in ANY of these layers as a 'potential anomaly' for further investigation. Use the visualization rasters (`hillshade_rgb`, `tint_overlay`) for context and orientation."
