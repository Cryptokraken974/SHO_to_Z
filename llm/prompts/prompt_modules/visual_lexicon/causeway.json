  "description": "Long, narrow, and often curvilinear raised earthen paths. These features may connect platforms, ceremonial areas, or follow natural contours. Although often subtle, they show structured continuity, consistent width, and elevation contrast. Visibility improves with slope or LRM rasters. Unlike modern roads, ancient causeways may curve gently or sharply.",
