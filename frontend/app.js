 * - js/utils.js        - Utility functions and helpers
 * - js/websocket.js    - WebSocket communication
 * - js/map.js          - Map initialization and controls
 * - js/fileManager.js  - LAZ file management
 * - js/overlays.js     - Map overlay management
 * - js/processing.js   - Processing operations
 * - js/ui.js           - UI interactions and interface
 * - js/app_new.js      - Main application coordinator
 * 
 * Original backup saved as: app_original_backup.js
 * 
 * For development, please edit the individual module files in the js/ directory.
